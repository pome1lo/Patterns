# Design Patterns in C#

This repository showcases implementations of fundamental design patterns in C#, covering creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Each pattern is demonstrated through easy-to-understand, practical examples, illustrating how to solve common software design challenges. 

## Patterns Included:
- **Builder**: Simplifies complex object creation by separating construction and representation.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.
- **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms or strategies into separate classes, making them interchangeable.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without modifying their structure.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding its complexity.

## Features:
- Clean, concise code with clear comments and explanations for each pattern.
- Each pattern follows best practices for object-oriented design.
- Examples that can easily be extended and integrated into real-world applications.
- Focus on flexibility, maintainability, and reusability.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore each design pattern in its respective folder.
3. Run and modify the code to better understand how each pattern works in practice.

Whether you're learning design patterns or looking to implement them in your projects, this repository serves as a helpful resource for understanding and applying key object-oriented principles in C#.
